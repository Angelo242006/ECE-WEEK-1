I activated the red light today through code and setting my input (p 4.1) and my output (p 1.0) to make it glow red (this word was already done for me. However, for the green light I had to restrucutre the code by removing a comment, making sure my input aligns and changing a or command to a hat command. After this, my input (p2.3) and output (p 6.6) aligned to make the green light turn on.
